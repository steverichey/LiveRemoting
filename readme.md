# [Live Remoting](http://steverichey.github.io/LiveRemoting/)

Build by running `haxe project.hxml` from the command line. Haxe will output JS and SWF files in the `bin` directory, as well as copying over `index.html`. Opening `index.html` will then allow you to test the application, or you can simply visit the GitHub page [here](http://steverichey.github.io/LiveRemoting/).

# About
